                Internet, when we think about this word, we can quickly think of the scope as well rapidly changing
                technologies that have become the backbone of the modern era changes. Internet is not destined to one
                person.
                It is the fruitful collaboration of a number of scientists, program planners, engineers who each
                contributed
                to bring the
                internet to its current form. </p>

            <p>
                Before the invention of the Internet, scientists around the world already were expecting such a
                connected
                network. Shortly after that, computer scientists developed the concept of “packet switching”
                which is a form of electronic data transfer that became the building blocks for internet architecture.
                Nikola Tesla stated “the world wireless system” around the 1900's, where Paul Outlet and Vanessa Bush
                came up with the concept of a mechanical
                search system for storage of books and media in the mid-1900's. </p>

                ARPANET, which arrived in the late 1960's is the first working prototypes of modern internet.
                It was originally funded by the US Department of Defense which allowed multiple systems communicating
                on a single network. Technology continues to thrive after that and soon the TCP / IP model was
                introduced.
                This sets the transfer rate for data on multiple networks. This protocol was adopted by the
                ARPANET in the 1980s provided momentum in the online world.
            </p>

            <p>
                The ARPANET is often confused with today's internet, but the internet we know today was founded by
                Tim Berners Lee in 1990 via the World Wide Web. The web is actually a way to access online data with
                the help of websites and hyperlinks. But the Web has helped to increase and expand access to the vast
                ocean of information every day. Since the birth of the World Wide Web, the Internet has changed in many
                ways. In 1992, a team of researchers at the University of Illinois developed a web browser called
                "Mosaic" which later became known as "Netscape". This provided a user-friendly way to search for
                information across the web. It allowed users to browse thousands of photos and navigate to
                different pages which are first of a kind experience for users of that age.

                The architects of internet designed a common language that could be used for transmission of data across
                any network. Eventually these rules became the lingua franca of the internet architecture. During the
                same period of time, Congress decided to commercialize the Web. The reason behind the jubilant victory
                of internet is its flexibility. It fetches data to and from billions of devices conveying our messages
                across variety of network in fraction of second’s time.


                One of the most important things to understand about the roots of the internet is that it is developed
                from military purpose. But the people who built the internet understood its design implications and
                hence
                tailored it to fulfill those requirements accordingly. The reason internet works across any device,
                at any given corner of the globe is because it is needed to be ubiquitous as the security apparatus
                that financed its development. By binding different networks together so seamlessly, makes internet
                feel like a single space on its own. And this network has
                been expanding ever since its inception creating an ease to accessibility of information for people.
