                It all started with 2 students from Stanford in the heart of Silicon Valley, Jerry Yang and David Filo.
                Today they have founded Yahoo! one of the hottest sites on the web. Their big break started when they
                wanted to heck Stanford’s fantasy basketball league. Those Electronic Engineering students with their
                access to the web, especially David acquired all the data form earlier night’s game, punched it in, and
                tried figuring out whether they should bet on, trade or change the players. It was a fantasy for virgin
                web users, how to find, browse and surf over the stuffs online. Unlike today, it was just compilation of
                categories and subcategories.
            </p>

                In 2007 Google and Yahoo! alone generated billions of dollars, but still no one used it for business or
                commerce. Then the era of advertisement took over and still reluctant to choose their faith, they had
                their views.

                Their new rival excites, with a tug of war over the sole authority, one after another launched updates,
                extensions, emails. But the hard part still persisted; neither of them can locate the desired
                information from the web. But soon again another resolution came from couple of students in Stanford. A
                new name Google emerged, meaning 10 to the power of hundred, with their founders as barely socialized
                junkies college grads, Larry Paige, Surgay Brin. Their basic formula was simple, it started with a
                notion that web was running continuous popularity contest on existing own content. And the number of
                times a webpage linked to a site might be a measure of how useful or relevant it was. It was the core of
                Google’s interim success. Due to huge traffic, University’s internet falling down and they were advised
                to move off campus.

                Vinod Khosla, venture capitalist, trade guru and cofounder of Sun Microsystem got them on board by
                offering them one million to sell themselves in a sushi restaurant. So out of frustration they reached a
                computer science professor, David Cheriton. But later they moved on to Andy Bechelscheim who funded 100
                of thousands. Still they moved on and accompanied John Doerr and responded of raising a revenue of 10
                million in later future. He funded them over $12 million. In order to boost their revenue they
                implemented ads in the own Silicon Valley way, simply copying the code from Bill Gross. Later with him,
                they improvised with a simple box for query, below unchanged results by Google and on the right were the
                ads.

                On August 19 2004, Google went public listing a share of sales on NASDAQ stock market. 3 Years after
                that, it boosted more revenue than McDonald, FedEx, Intel, Coca-Cola, IBM, Walmart. Their shares were
                bought in $100 and sold in $700. As the Google responded its reach in multiple corners of commerce,
                their foes have gone longer and more formidable.
