            <h3>Gist of Internet</h3>
            <p> Internet was designed by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf. They started their work in the early 1970s. It was the
                result of the another experiment called the ARPANET, which was used for defense department, research
                project.Paul Baran who was deciding on how to build a communication network, that can survive attack,
                came up with the idea of distributing the network into packet switched netowork, where a message could
                be broken into blocks and they could be sent fast and with every direction possible.</p>
            <h3>Who is in charge of the internet?</h3>
            <p>The internet is made up of independently operating networks. How packets are routed, who interconnects
                with whom is all distributed. It in not controlled by the operators. There is end to end connectivity.It
                gives people opportunity to build their own application, to be a part of the growing infrastructure of
                the internet and help people who do not have access to internet.</p>

            <h3>How do messages get sent between devices?</h3>
            <p> This as well is through internet, which is defined as the tangible physical system made to move
                information. There are 2 components sender and the receiver. The information is sent in the form of
                binary, in the form of bits. They have binary codes. These are the atoms of information. Now the bits
                are typically sent by light, electricity, radio. By electricity, it means they are connected by copper
                wires. When both the end sytems have 1 which means on, they send the messges to each other. There is a
                timer through which more bits can be sent within the time interval. There are other parameters like
                bandwidth, latency, bitrate which decide the speed, the amount of bits sent, the rate at which it is
                sent respectively. Bit these lines could not be used in the oceans. This is when light came to picture.
                This is faster than light. These uses fibre optic cable to transfer bits as light beam. This fibre optic
                cable is like a thread of glass designed to reflect light. Multiple bits can be sent, which travel in
                the speed of light. But this is expensive and they used wires. This lead to the wireless transmission
                through the radio signal. But they do not travel far like the light cables. </p>
