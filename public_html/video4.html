            <p><b>Ebay</b> and<b> Amazon</b> burst upon the scene in the year 1990. For amazon, their story started as
                Jeff started his business in a garage in Seattle with his vision to create an online bookstore. His
                views were, it was impossible for a bookstore to have millions of different books physically somewhere.
                During that period Pierre Amidyar, just a humble coder, but had an idea of building an online auction
                site. After Labor Day, 1994, he sat down to create just a simple code in which we can create an ad, we
                can list up all the similar ads, and bid in similar items of others. At the time of their startup, their
                pickings were petty like celebrity signed underwear, a toy firetruck, few computers related accessories,
                antique furniture and a superhero lunchbox. </p>

            <p> By the time of mid 1990s faster, cheaper and more powerful PCs were getting interconnected making
                network exponentially more useful and powerful.

                At first amazon pictured themselves as a giant bookstore. According to Bezos, Profits really were not
                the primary focus. He added that later that, in gold-rush moments and during the development of web,
                profits could and should be sacrificed temporarily in favor of rapid growth. That was “Strategy-Bezos”,
                which can be brought down to 3 simple words, “get big fast”. He thought it was vital as they can give
                customers certain amount of exposure and satisfaction only if they’re grown to a certain scale. </p>
            <p>Later, three mathematicians of California developed public key cryptography. Public key is used to
                encrypt rendering secrets of a confidential data, whereas private key which is a combination used by
                receiver by decrypting the data and produce the original message.

                In spring 1998, Pierre realized that they need an A-list businessperson’s help. Meanwhile even after
                posting losses of millions of dollars, still the revenue of Amazon doubled. This was a time, with the
                startup of new businesses in a Ganz new economy where rules of gravity and physics cannot anymore hold
                us down, lead to a business of day traders. They buy stocks from sitting comfortably on their
                couches. </p>

            <h4>E-commerce Secured</h4>
            <p>Developing Public Key Cryptography was crucial to secure the transactions and personal information,as the
                business grew. This is when Public Key Cryptography was developed by Ralph Merkel,Whitfield Diffie, and
                Martin Hellman.Over time, E-Commerce became a common thing for anyone with access to the internet.
                DotCom became a trend. This impacted the stock market a lot. The dotcom boom was a bubble, but it
                however came to an end when it crashed in 2000& 2001. Although some companies failed, there were many
                that thrived. Amazon and eBay set an example by being the most established E-commerce companies. They
                cared about their customers more than profits, and it is what helped them grow.</p>
