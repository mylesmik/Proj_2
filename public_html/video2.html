                In 1993, Mark Anderson (Founder, MOSAIC) launched and tested MOSAIC with 12 people. The test was a
                success and slowly the word about MOSAIC spread and everyone started using it.

                In February 1994, they took a plane to Illinois in order to form a team to expand their business and to
                have a free web browser for all. Bill Gates did not agree with this, he wanted the whole world to use
                the internet through some kind of toll both for which he had designed MSN.com.
                He was arrogant and did not accept or agree to any new ideas.

                In the Summer of 1994, Jim Clarke and his team developed NetScape in a few months. It was better than
                MOSAIC and they knew they had to improve their browser to make it better and more compelling.

                On 13th October 1994, ‘Navigator’ browser was launched by NetScape. It got millions of downloads.
                Microsoft realised that they were not the only giants in the IT industry anymore.
                Bill Gates was shook by NetScape’s success and sent out a memo called ‘Internet Tidal Wave’ where he
                declared that the Web is the single most important component and that they had to match the level of
                NetScape or get better and beat NetScape.

                By 1995, the Internet was a global phenomenon. NetScape started expanding their business. They fired
                Gary Reback, an antitrust lawyer who worked and fought for companies in the Silicon Valley, such as
                Microsoft.

                Microsoft arranged a meeting with NetScape and offered them 1M$ to buy NetScape or else they told them
                that they would copy their idea regardless, so might as well make money out of it but this was against
                the law so NetScape asked Reback to sue Microsoft, who felt that this was just a huge setup by NetScape.

                NetScape wanted to go public with an IPO but Wall Street had only allowed companies with at least 2
                years business experience period whereas NetScape only had 1 year of this experience. However, on the
                day of the IPO release, their stocks went through the roof. They had invested 5M$ which on the day of
                the IPO release went up to 663M$.

                NetScape became arrogant like Microsoft. Jim Clark announced publicly that he thought Microsoft was not
                relevant anymore and that Microsoft was a dead company.

                On December 7 1995, Microsoft let the world know that they were not done yet with the release of the
                Internet Explorer in order to beat NetScape. In 1995 people referred to the browser as NetScape but this
                was about to change. NetScape was in trouble as Microsoft had better salesmen and better marketing teams
                which were their hidden weapons. Their salesmen convinced people to not install anything other than
                Internet Explorer.

                Internet Explorer was free as compared to Netscape, this too was an important factor why people
                preferred Internet Explorer over Netscape. By the time of the release of Internet Explorer 4.0 almost
                90% of the traffic on the internet used Internet Explorer.

                By September of 1997, the Browser war was over and Microsoft had won it. They threw a huge party as a
                celebration for the same. Clark had made 2B$ out of the invested 5M$.

                After a few years, Reback sued Microsoft and the Government was now aware of Microsoft’s illegal
                monopoly and predatory practices to stop Netscape from being used and sold.

                Bill Gates was taken to court where he was asked many questions regarding the 1995 meeting, he had with
                Netscape, he denied all the accusations made but there was email evidence of him saying all the things
                that he was accused for.

                Bill Gates was found guilty and there was a verdict to split the company, as the news about this spread,
                their stocks were affected overnight and it went down by 30Bn$. Gates was sick after all this took
                place; the Court felt that the verdict was too harsh so they decided to take back the verdict of
                splitting the company. However, Gates gave up his position as CEO and appointed Steve Ballmer as
                Microsoft’s new CEO.
